transformation steps to produce a TYPO3 sphinx documentation project.

Openoffice
==========
It is expected that OpenOffice headless is up and running on the server.
We are using OpenOffice for converting OpenOffice documents to HTML.

.. attention::

   OpenOffice tends to "hang" if asked to convert SXW-manuals that aren't
   error free ZIP archives. Check for archive integrity before passing
   a conversion job over to OpenOffice.
